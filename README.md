# IT-Club-Management-System
A simple C++ project on IT club management system. This is my first project.
Currently, we can log in as member or the moderator of the club.
            A general member can view all members and upcoming events.
            Moderator can add new members and add new events as well as see upcoming events.
And that's all!
Hoping to update it soon...
